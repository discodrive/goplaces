# GoPlaces

A Go API for collecting and rating places to go out as a family. We are useless at deciding what to do so this is to help us select activities and keep track of places we like to go.

As a learning exercise this API doesn't use Gin or many other Go packages and instead attempts to handle as much as possible by itself.

## Endpoints

`/places`
Returns a list of all places
